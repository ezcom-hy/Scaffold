Run this command. You can download this project in your local environment

```

```

## Description

zendesk에서 지원하는 scaffold를 업그레이드 한 `react-template` 입니다.

기존 scaffold는 `class component`로 되어있으며, 특정 라이브러리 버전들이 낮거나 지원을 하고 있지 않습니다.

[apps for Zendesk products](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/apps-v2/getting_started).

## Changed

- 폴더 구조
- 클래스 컴포넌트 -> 함수형 컴포넌트
- babel, react 버전 업그레이드

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 18.12.1
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) = 2.6.x

### Setup

1. Clone or fork this repo
2. Run `yarn`

To run your app locally in Zendesk, you need the latest [Zendesk CLI](https://github.com/zendesk/zcli).

### Running locally

`?zcli_apps=true`로 Zendesk 인스턴스에 앱을 제공하려면 새 터미널을 열고 다음을 실행합니다.

```
yarn watch
```

그런 다음 현재 프로젝트 경로에서 새 터미널을 열고 다음을 실행합니다.

```
yarn start
```

## Edit application info

`react-template`을 clone 한 뒤에, 조건에 맞게 zendesk에서 나타낼 정보를 수정해야합니다.

```
<!-- manifest.json -->
{
"name": "[application name]",
  "author": {
    "name": "[name]",
    "email": "[email]",
    "url": "[url(optional)]"
  },

   "location": {
    "support": {
      }
    }
  },
```

#### dist

The dist directory is created when you run the app building scripts. You will need to package this folder when submitting your app to the Zendesk Apps Marketplace, It is also the folder you will have to serve when using [ZCLI](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/app-developer-guide/zcli/). It includes your app's manifest.json file, an assets folder with all your compiled JavaScript and CSS as well as HTML and images.

#### spec

The spec directory is where all your tests and test helpers live. Tests are not required to submit/upload your app to Zendesk and your test files are not included in your app's package, however it is good practice to write tests to document functionality and prevent bugs.

#### src

The src directory is where your raw source code lives. The App Scaffold includes different directories for JavaScript, stylesheets, templates, images and translations. Most of your additions will be in here (and spec, of course!).

#### webpack

This directory contains custom tooling to process translations at build time:

- translations-loader.js is used by Webpack to convert .json translation files to JavaScript objects, for the app itself.
- translations-plugin.js is used to extract compulsory translation strings from the en.json file that are used to display metadata about your app on the Zendesk Apps Marketplace.

#### .babelrc

[.babelrc](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babelrc.html) is the configuration file for babel compiler.

#### .browserslistrc

.browserslistrc is a configuration file to specify browsers supported by your application, some develop/build tools read info from this file if it exists in your project root. At present, our scaffolding doesn't reply on this file, [default browserslist query](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#queries) is used by [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env/) and [PostCSS](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-preset-env#browsers)

#### jest.config.js

[jest.config.js](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html) is the configuration file for Jest

#### package.json

package.json is the configuration file for [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), which is a package manager for JavaScript. This file includes information about your project and its dependencies. For more information on how to configure this file, see [Yarn package.json](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/package-json).

#### postcss.config.js

postcss.config.js is the configuration file for [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)

#### webpack.config.js

webpack.config.js is a configuration file for [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). Webpack is a JavaScript module bundler. For more information about webpack and how to configure it, see [What is webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/what-is-webpack.html).

## Helpers

The App Scaffold provides some helper functions in `/src/javascripts/lib/helpers.js` to help building apps.

### I18n

The I18n (internationalization) module in `/src/javascripts/lib/i18n.js` provides a `t` method to look up translations based on a key. For more information, see [Using the I18n module](https://github.com/zendesk/app_scaffolds/blob/master/packages/react/doc/i18n.md).

For more information on the Zendesk CLI please see the [documentation](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/app-developer-guide/zcli/).

## External Dependencies

External dependencies are defined in [webpack.config.js](https://github.com/zendesk/app_scaffolds/blob/master/packages/react/webpack.config.js). This ensures these dependencies are included in your app's `index.html`.
